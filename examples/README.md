# Blog Post Examples

This directory contains simplified code snippets and demonstrations for blog posts.
These examples prioritize clarity and concept demonstration over production-ready code.

## Structure

- `inconsistencies/` - Examples demonstrating cache inconsistency scenarios
- `basic_caches/` - Simple cache implementations for educational purposes

## Usage

These examples are standalone Python scripts that can be run directly:

```bash
python examples/inconsistencies/example_name.py
```

Note: These are teaching examples, not production implementations. For full-featured
cache implementations, see the `src/cache_mechanics/` directory.
